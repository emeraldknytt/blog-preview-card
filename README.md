###  Acknowledgement 

Special thanks to [MatPawluk](https://wwww.frontendmentor.io/profile/MatPawLuk) for the insightful corrections and advice. In response to his suggestions, I have made this changes, and while I could have added under an "Update" section. I am dedicating this section to him. Thanks MatPawLuk!
`changes made`
- Modified `body width` to `100vh` for page responsiveness.
- Changed `description` styling from `id` selector to `class` selector
- Edited `alt attribute` of illustration `svg` file to `illustration-logo`

I would also like to thank [Teodor Jenkler](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/TedJenkler) for explaining a few tips that will help improve the readability of my code and accessibilty of my webpage. Adhering to his tips, I made these changes.... Thanks Teodor!

- Used a `main` tag to wrap the content of the profile card instead of `div`
- Got rid of the unnecessary divs I had in my code 
- Learned about `time` element (suggested by Teodor) and used it in my HTML code.


###   Note

There are a few css selectors that have similar property-value pair. Optimise `css` file when you have a chance to do that.
